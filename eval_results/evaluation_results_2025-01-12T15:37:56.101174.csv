"What command is used to create a new database in
ClickHouse, and what is the purpose of the `IF NOT
EXISTS` clause?
","The command used to create a new database in
ClickHouse is `CREATE DATABASE`. The purpose of
the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause is to prevent an error
from occurring if the database you are trying to
create already exists. This allows the command to
execute without interruption, ensuring that the
database creation is attempted only if it is not
already present.
","Creating Tables in ClickHouse


 Like most databases, ClickHouse logically groups
tables into **databases**. Use the `CREATE
DATABASE` command to create a new database in
ClickHouse:


  ```sql

  CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS helloworld

  ```


Similarly, use `CREATE TABLE` to define a new
table. (If you do not specify the database name,
the table will be in the

`default` database.) The following table named is
`my_first_table` in the `helloworld` database:


  ```sql

  CREATE TABLE helloworld.my_first_table

  (

      user_id UInt32,

      message String,

      timestamp DateTime,

      metric Float32

  )

  ENGINE = MergeTree()

  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, timestamp)

  ```


In the example above, `my_first_table` is a
`MergeTree` table with four columns:


- `user_id`:  a 32-bit unsigned integer

- `message`: a `String` data type, which replaces
types like `VARCHAR`, `BLOB`, `CLOB` and others
from other database systems

- `timestamp`: a `DateTime` value, which
represents an instant in time

- `metric`: a 32-bit floating point number


  :::note

  The table engine determines:

   - How and where the data is stored

   - Which queries are supported

   - Whether or not the data is replicated


  There are many engines to choose from, but for a
simple table on a single-node ClickHouse server,
MergeTree is your likely choice.

(the implementation

    - primary keys in ClickHouse are **_not

  The primary key of a ClickHouse table determines
how the data is sorted when written to disk. Every
8,192 rows or 10MB of

  data (referred to as the **index granularity**)
creates an entry in the primary key index file.
This granularity concept

  creates a **sparse index** that can easily fit
in memory, and the granules represent a stripe of
the smallest amount of

  column data that gets processed during `SELECT`
queries.


  The primary key can be defined using the
`PRIMARY KEY` parameter. If you define a table
without a `PRIMARY KEY` specified,

  then the key becomes the tuple specified in the
`ORDER BY` clause. If you specify both a `PRIMARY
KEY` and an `ORDER BY`, the primary key must be a
prefix of the sort order.


  The primary key is also the sorting key, which
is a tuple of `(user_id, timestamp)`.  Therefore,
the data stored in each

  column file will be sorted by `user_id`, then
`timestamp`.

"What is the significance of the index granularity
in ClickHouse, and how does it affect data
processing during `SELECT` queries?
","The significance of index granularity in
ClickHouse lies in its role in optimizing data
retrieval during `SELECT` queries. Index
granularity determines the size of the data blocks
that ClickHouse uses to store and access data. A
finer granularity allows for more precise
indexing, which can lead to faster query
performance because the system can skip over
irrelevant data blocks when executing a query.


When a `SELECT` query is executed, ClickHouse can
leverage the index granularity to quickly identify
which parts of the data need to be read, thus
reducing the amount of data scanned and improving
overall efficiency. This is particularly important
in large datasets, where minimizing the amount of
data processed can significantly enhance query
response times. Therefore, the choice of index
granularity directly impacts the speed and
efficiency of data processing in ClickHouse.
","SELECT Queries in ClickHouse


ClickHouse is a SQL database, and you query your
data by writing the same type of `SELECT` queries
you are already familiar with. For example:


```sql

SELECT *

FROM helloworld.my_first_table

ORDER BY timestamp

```


:::note

View the SQL Reference for more details on the
syntax and available clauses and options.

Notice the response comes back in a nice table
format:


```response

Add a `FORMAT` clause to specify one of the many
supported output formats of ClickHouse:

```sql

"Why might a user choose the `MergeTree` engine for

","A user might choose the `MergeTree` engine for a
simple table on a single-node ClickHouse server
due to its optimization for high performance and
scalability. The `MergeTree` engine allows for
efficient handling of large volumes of data,
enabling potentially millions of rows to be
inserted per second. It is designed for append-
only operations, which aligns well with the
typical use cases in analytical processing.
Additionally, using `MergeTree` ensures that the
data is eventually consistent, making it suitable
for scenarios where immediate consistency is not a
critical requirement. This engine also benefits
from efficient column-oriented compression,
further enhancing performance.
","Insert to a MergeTree table or a distributed table


We recommend inserting directly into a MergeTree
(or Replicated table), balancing the requests
across a set of nodes if the data is sharded, and
setting `internal_replication=true`.

This will leave ClickHouse to replicate the data
to any available replica shards and ensure the
data is eventually consistent.


If this client side load balancing is inconvenient
then users can insert via a distributed table
which will then distribute writes across the
nodes. Again, it is advised to set
`internal_replication=true`.

It should be noted however that this approach is a
little less performant as writes have to be made
locally on the node with the distributed table and
then sent to the shards.

point number used to store numerical metrics
related to the entries.
","Creating Tables in ClickHouse


 Like most databases, ClickHouse logically groups
tables into **databases**. Use the `CREATE
DATABASE` command to create a new database in
ClickHouse:


  ```sql

  CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS helloworld

  ```


Similarly, use `CREATE TABLE` to define a new
table. (If you do not specify the database name,
the table will be in the

`default` database.) The following table named is
`my_first_table` in the `helloworld` database:


  ```sql

  CREATE TABLE helloworld.my_first_table

  (

      user_id UInt32,

      message String,

      timestamp DateTime,

      metric Float32

  )

  ENGINE = MergeTree()

  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, timestamp)

  ```


In the example above, `my_first_table` is a
`MergeTree` table with four columns:


- `user_id`:  a 32-bit unsigned integer

- `message`: a `String` data type, which replaces
types like `VARCHAR`, `BLOB`, `CLOB` and others
from other database systems

- `timestamp`: a `DateTime` value, which
represents an instant in time

- `metric`: a 32-bit floating point number


  :::note

  The table engine determines:

   - How and where the data is stored

   - Which queries are supported

   - Whether or not the data is replicated


  There are many engines to choose from, but for a
simple table on a single-node ClickHouse server,
MergeTree is your likely choice.

  ## A Brief Intro to Primary Keys


  Before you go any further, it is important to
understand how primary keys work in ClickHouse
(the implementation

  of primary keys might seem unexpected!):


    - primary keys in ClickHouse are **_not
unique_** for each row in a table


  The primary key of a ClickHouse table determines
how the data is sorted when written to disk. Every
8,192 rows or 10MB of

  data (referred to as the **index granularity**)
creates an entry in the primary key index file.
This granularity concept

  creates a **sparse index** that can easily fit
in memory, and the granules represent a stripe of
the smallest amount of

  column data that gets processed during `SELECT`
queries.


  The primary key can be defined using the
`PRIMARY KEY` parameter. If you define a table
without a `PRIMARY KEY` specified,

  then the key becomes the tuple specified in the
`ORDER BY` clause. If you specify both a `PRIMARY
KEY` and an `ORDER BY`, the primary key must be a
prefix of the sort order.


  The primary key is also the sorting key, which
is a tuple of `(user_id, timestamp)`.  Therefore,
the data stored in each

  column file will be sorted by `user_id`, then
`timestamp`.

By default, each insert sent to ClickHouse causes
ClickHouse to immediately create a part of storage
containing the data from the insert together with
other metadata that needs to be stored.

Therefore, sending a smaller amount of inserts
that each contain more data, compared to sending a
larger amount of inserts that each contain less
data, will reduce the number of writes required.

Generally, we recommend inserting data in fairly
large batches of at least 1,000 rows at a time,
and ideally between 10,000 to 100,000 rows.

(Further details here).

"What is the timestamp for the message ""Granules

","The provided context does not contain any

""Granules are the smallest chunks of data read.""
","Use asynchronous inserts for small batches


There are scenarios where client-side batching is
not feasible e.g. an observability use case with
100s or 1000s of single-purpose agents sending
logs, metrics, traces, etc.

In this scenario real-time transport of that data
is key to detect issues and anomalies as quickly
as possible.

Furthermore, there is a risk of event spikes in
the observed systems, which could potentially
cause large memory spikes and related issues when
trying to buffer observability data client-side.

If large batches cannot be inserted, users can
delegate batching to ClickHouse using asynchronous
inserts.


With asynchronous inserts, data is inserted into a
buffer first and then written to the database
storage later in 3 steps, as illustrated by the
diagram below:




<img src={require('./images/postgres-
inserts.png').default}

     className=""image""

     alt=""NEEDS ALT""

     style={{width: '600px'}}

/>




With asynchronous inserts enabled, ClickHouse:


(1) receives an insert query asynchronously.

(2) writes the query's data into an in-memory
buffer first.

(3) sorts and writes the data as a part to the
database storage, only when the next buffer flush
takes place.


Before the buffer gets flushed, the data of other
asynchronous insert queries from the same or other
clients can be collected in the buffer.

The part created from the buffer flush will
potentially contain the data from several
asynchronous insert queries.

Generally, these mechanics shift the batching of
data from the client side to the server side
(ClickHouse instance).


:::note

Note that the data is not searchable by queries
before being flushed to the database storage and
that the buffer flush is configurable.


Full details on configuring asynchronous inserts
can be found here, with a deep dive here.
